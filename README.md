# Der-Eiserne-Thron--Begleitapp
My first Python Project. This is an accompanying app for the board game "Der Eiserene Thron" (a stratigic board game in the unsiverse of Game of Thrones)

## Overview
This repository consits of 
- a client application in the form of a Progressive Web App (PWA) written in JavaScript (with HTML and CSS) to interact with the clients.
- a server application written in Python to manage the Game Flow and synchronize the Players.
